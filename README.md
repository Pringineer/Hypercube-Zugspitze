# Hypercube-Zugspitze

This is my take on a printer design inspired by the Hypercube Evolution from SCOTT_3D.

# Design
My main design goal was to make it more visually appealing but more importantly to make it enclosed so it was possible to print more demanding/picky materials on it such as ABS, ASA, PC, etc. 
Another design goal was to reduce the total part count which I am still working on.

# Features
- Fully enclosed build chamber
- Backpack style electronics
- Mains heated print bed
- 200mm^2 build area
- Voron Afterburner hotend adaptation
- Blind jointed frame
- Annex engineering micro switch magnetic probe
- Klipper firmware
- Air filter (activated Carbon & HEPA13)

More features such as lighting are in the planning but not implemented as of yet. I am also planning to write a full set of assembly instructions and publish all firmware configurations and such on here at a later point. 

# Important notes
This project is still a work in progress and everything is subject to change. I am mostly done ordering parts and have started assembling individual sections of the printer.
